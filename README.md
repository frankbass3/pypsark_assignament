src/: Contains the application's core logic, separated by functional areas such as transformations, utils, etc.

tests/: Holds all test-related files, organized into unit and integration tests.

config/: Contains configuration files, such as URLs, paths, schema configurations, etc., that can be modified without changing the code.

Dependency Management:
    Dependencies should be handled using pip and managed via a requirements.txt file or setup.py. This allows for repeatable installations of project dependencies.

    requirements.txt:

    plaintext
    Copy
    pyspark==3.2.1
    requests==2.26.0
    pytest==6.2.5
    flake8==3.9.2
    pylint==2.9.6

Configuration Management:

    External configuration files allow users to change parameters such as service URLs, paths, and schema without modifying the source code.

    Example: config/config.yaml:

    yaml
    Copy
    service:
    url: "https://api.hashify.net/hash/md4/hex?value="

    paths:
    source_data: "/data/contracts.csv"
    target_data: "/data/transactions.parquet"

    schema:
    contract_schema:
        - SOURCE_SYSTEM
        - CONTRACT_ID
        - CONTRACT_TYPE
        - INSURED_PERIOD_FROM
        - INSURED_PERIOD_TO
        - CREATION_DATE
    claim_schema:
        - SOURCE_SYSTEM
        - CLAIM_ID
        - CONTRACT_SOURCE_SYSTEM
        - CONTRACT_ID
        - CLAIM_TYPE
        - DATE_OF_LOSS
        - AMOUNT
        - CREATION_DATE
    This structure allows for easy changes to configuration parameters like URLs and paths.

Automation and CI/CD Pipeline:
    Although you're not explicitly building a CI/CD pipeline, the goal is to ensure that the entire process, from dependency management to deployment, can be automated with a single command.

    Steps to Automate:
    Install dependencies: Use pip install -r requirements.txt to install the required packages.

    Run unit tests: Use pytest to run the unit tests and ensure the code works as expected.

    Static analysis and linting:

    Static analysis: Run flake8 or pylint to ensure code quality.

    Linting: Use black or autopep8 for code formatting.

Testing Strategy:
    Testing ensures code quality and data correctness. We can break it into:

    Code Quality Tests:
    Unit tests: Test individual components of the code (e.g., transformations, data processing functions).
    (insde the make.sh)

    Static analysis: Use tools like pylint, flake8, or black for ensuring that the code follows best practices and style guides.
    (insde the make.sh)

Components of the Dockerfile:
    Base Image: It starts from the official Bitnami Spark image (bitnami/spark:3.2.1), which includes a Spark installation. This image is optimized for running Spark in Docker containers.

    Environment Variables:

    SPARK_HOME and PATH are set to ensure Spark is available for PySpark.

    PYSPARK_PYTHON=python3 ensures Python 3 is used.

    Working Directory: The working directory is set to /app, which is where your application code will reside in the container.

    Install Dependencies: The requirements.txt file is copied into the container, and dependencies are installed using pip install.

    Copy Application Code: All the application files are copied into the container.

    ENTRYPOINT: The entry point is set to run the PySpark job using spark-submit. The --master local[*] runs the job locally using all available CPU cores, and --deploy-mode client ensures the driver runs in the client mode, i.e., on the same machine as the executor (this is typical for local development).

    /app/src/main.py is the path to your PySpark job script that should be executed.
